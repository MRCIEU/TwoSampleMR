  exponentiate = FALSE,
  single_snp_method = "Wald ratio",

}
\arguments{
\item{mr_res}{Results from \code{\link[=mr]{mr()}}.}

\item{exponentiate}{Convert effects to OR? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{single_snp_method}{Which of the single SNP methods to use when only 1 SNP was used to estimate the causal effect? The default is \code{"Wald ratio"}.}

\item{multi_snp_method}{Which of the multi-SNP methods to use when there was more than 1 SNPs used to estimate the causal effect? The default is \code{"Inverse variance weighted"}.}

\item{ao_slc}{Logical; retrieve sample size and subcategory using \code{\link[=available_outcomes]{available_outcomes()}}. If set to \code{FALSE} \code{mr_res} must contain the following additional columns: \code{subcategory} and \code{sample_size}.}

\item{priority}{Name of category to prioritise at the top of the forest plot. The default is \code{"Cardiometabolic"}.}

\description{
This function takes the results from \code{\link[=mr]{mr()}} and is particularly useful
if the MR has been applied using multiple exposures and multiple outcomes.
It creates a new data frame with the following:
\itemize{
\item Variables: exposure, outcome, category, outcome sample size, effect, upper ci, lower ci, pval, nsnp
\item only one estimate for each exposure-outcome
\item exponentiated effects if required
}
}
\details{
By default it uses the \code{\link[=available_outcomes]{available_outcomes()}} function to retrieve the study level characteristics for the outcome trait,
including sample size and outcome category.
This assumes the MR analysis was performed using outcome GWAS(s) contained in OpenGWAS.

If \code{ao_slc} is set to \code{TRUE} then the user must supply their own study level characteristics.
This is useful when the user has supplied their own outcome GWAS results (i.e. they are not in OpenGWAS).
